    <p>Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto
        Uzumaki,
        a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village.
        The
        story is told in two parts: the first is set in Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second in his
        teens
        (volumes 28–72). The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto
        an
        honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).</p>


    <p>Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from September 1999 to November
        2014, with
        its chapters collected in 72 tankōbon volumes. Viz Media licensed the manga for North American production and
        serialized
        Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. Part I of the manga was adapted into an anime television
        series by
        Pierrot and Aniplex, which ran for 220 episodes from October 2002 to February 2007 on TV Tokyo. A second series,
        which
        adapts material from Part II of the manga, is titled Naruto: Shippuden and ran on TV Tokyo for 500 episodes from
        February 2007 to March 2017. Pierrot also developed 11 animated films and 12 original video animations (OVAs).
        The
        franchise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies. The story of
        Naruto
        continues in Boruto, where Naruto's son Boruto Uzumaki creates his own ninja way instead of following his
        father's.</p>

    <P>aruto is one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having 250 million copies in circulation worldwide in
        47
        countries and regions, with 153 million copies in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies elsewhere. It has
        become
        one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English translations of the volumes have appeared on USA
        Today and
        The New York Times bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers
        praised
        the manga's character development, storylines, and action sequences, though some felt the latter slowed the
        story down.
        Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese
        mythology
        and Confucianism</P>

    <h1>Boruto</h1>
    <p>Boruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written by Ukyō Kodachi and Masashi Kishimoto, and illustrated by Mikio
        Ikemoto. It
        is a spin-off and a sequel to Kishimoto's Naruto and follows the exploits of Naruto Uzumaki's son Boruto Uzumaki
        and his
        ninja team. The manga began serialization under the title Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,[b] with Kodachi as
        writer and
        Kishimoto as editorial supervisor in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump in May 2016, and was
        transferred to Shueisha's monthly magazine V Jump in July 2019. In November 2020, Kodachi stepped down, with
        Kishimoto
        taking over as writer. In April 2023, the series concluded the first part of the story, and, following a brief
        hiatus,
        continued in August of the same year with a second part titled Boruto: Two Blue Vortex.[c]</p>

    <p>Boruto originated from Shueisha's proposal to Kishimoto on making a sequel to Naruto. However, Kishimoto rejected
        this
        offer and proposed his former assistant Mikio Ikemoto to draw it; the writer of the film Boruto: Naruto the
        Movie, Ukyō
        Kodachi, created the plot. A 293-episode anime television series adaptation, produced by Pierrot with Kodachi's
        story
        supervision (episodes 1–216), was broadcast on TV Tokyo from April 2017 to March 2023; a second part has been
        announced
        to be in development. Unlike the manga, which began as a retelling of the Boruto film, the anime begins as a
        prequel set
        before Boruto and his friends become ninjas in a later story arc. A series of light novels have also been
        written</p>
